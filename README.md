### Project Description
gentharvan is a playful web app that uses AI to analyze images or short videos and give a ‚ÄúCrush Score.‚Äù It‚Äôs designed to help you figure out if your friend might be acting suspiciously around someone else ‚Äî like if they secretly like another person.

The app uses facial recognition and emotion detection (with MediaPipe and DeepFace), plus eye and eyebrow movement analysis (OpenCV), to spot subtle cues like nervousness or surprise. It also scans optional user text for suspicious keywords.

Based on these signals, it calculates a humor-weighted ‚ÄúSus Score‚Äù (0‚Äì100%) and shows fun meme animations and labels ‚Äî making the whole experience both tech-savvy and entertaining.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Prove that my friend has a crush technincally and with AI

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
It‚Äôs hard to tell when someone‚Äôs low-key acting sus or hiding their feelings around others. This app uses AI to spot those sneaky signs in photos, videos, and texts ‚Äî then turns it all into hilarious memes and scores you can share.
